# AfriAtlas: Visualizing African Bird Atlas Data

The **`AfriAtlas`** R package provides robust, publication-ready tools for ecologists and enthusiasts to download, process, and visualize pentad-level bird atlas data from the **African Bird Atlas Project (ABAP)** and its associated country projects (like Nigeria Bird Atlas Project).

The package is designed for portability and efficiency, handling dynamic boundaries via the `rnaturalearth` package and enforcing API safety limits.

## 🚀 Installation

You can install the development version of `AfriAtlas` directly from GitHub using the `remotes` package.

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
# Install necessary dependencies if you haven't already
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

# Install AfriAtlas 
remotes::install_github("bdanmallam/AfriAtlas")
```

# Quick Usage Examples

## 1. Finding and Reviewing Species Codes
The mapping functions require numeric Species Codes (e.g., 11491 for Common Bulbul). AfriAtlas provides three tools to help you manage these codes.

## A. Lookup a Code by Name: get_species_code()
If you know the English common name, you can quickly retrieve the code. This function is case-sensitive.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Find code for Common Bulbul
code <- get_species_code("Common Bulbul")
print(code)

# Find code for Pin-tailed Whydah
get_species_code("Pin-tailed Whydah")
```

## B. Browse All Species: explore_species_codes()
If you are unsure of the spelling or want to browse the full species codes, this function opens the internal dataset in the RStudio Viewer.

(Note: This function works only in interactive sessions).

```{r eval=FALSE}
explore_species_codes()
```

## C. Reviewing Species Codes: show_codes()
Before running a batch process, it is best practice to review the list of codes being used. The show_codes() function is a simple utility for this. Note that the primary mapping function, map_species(), will stop execution if the list exceeds Spp 10 codes.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Example list of species codes (e.g., common African species)
my_species_list <- c(129, 311, 437, 846, 11491, 1168)

# Check the list size
show_codes(my_species_list)

# Example of a list exceeding the limit (Will stop map_species() execution)
# show_codes(c(1:12))
```


# 2. Map Species Distribution (map_species)
Generates a map of species sightings versus coverage, including a widespreadness pie chart. Execution is halted if more than 10 species are requested.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(AfriAtlas)

# Generate a single species map for South Africa (Pin-tailed Whydah)
map_species(species_codes = 846, country = "Nigeria")

# Generate maps for a batch of species in Kenya (saved as PNGs)
map_species(species_codes = c(129, 311), country = "Kenya")
```

# 3. Map Survey Effort (map_coverage)
Generates a map showing the total full-protocol survey hours (effort) per pentad. Categories are dynamically adjusted based on the maximum effort level found in the country.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Generate effort map for Nigeria 
map_coverage("Nigeria")

# Generate effort map for South Africa 
map_coverage("South Africa")
```
